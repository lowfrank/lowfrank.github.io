    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Francesco, 
      and I'm an engineering student based in 
      <a 
        href="https://www.polito.it" 
        target="_blank" 
        rel="noreferrer"
        ><b>Politecnico of Turin</b></a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional interests are the business and manufacturing environments. 
      However, I've developed a strong passion for the software development world, 
      and I've learned programming on my own to automate tasks and work on projects that attract me.
      My areas of interest are various, ranging from GUI development to 
      data analysis, web scraping and programming language writing and design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first studied <a 
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" 
      target="_blank" 
      rel="noreferrer"
      ><b>C</b></a> at university. The course intrigued me to explore the 
      world of software development, and consequently in 2020 I decided to dig into <a 
        href="https://www.python.org" 
        target="_blank" 
        rel="noreferrer"
      ><b>Python</b></a>, due to its versatility and ease of use. 
      After mastering its features and capabilities, in 2021 I started to explore <a 
        href="https://www.rust-lang.org" 
        target="_blank" 
        rel="noreferrer"
      ><b>Rust</b></a> to learn a modern and fast statically typed language.
        I consider myself proficient in both languages and I use them in my everyday programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I enjoy going to the gym and playing soccer, as well as volleyball.
      I'm also keen on photography, both digital and analogic, and I love going on trips and
      visiting places with my friends.
    </p>

      Thanks for stopping by!
